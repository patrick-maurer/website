This is my first personal webpage project.

Hello, nice to meet you.

I am a person who likes to lose myself in challenging problems that require a lot of perseverance and dedication. Whether it's developing and analyzing theoretical models to better understand the physical world, running and training for ultratrails, or constantly learning new things.

Speaking of physics, I have a PhD in theoretical physics and work as a postdoctoral researcher in the group of Oriol Romero-Isart [1]. We are a team of motivated and passionate people and together we tackle research questions in theoretical quantum physics. During the last years, I have had the privilege of collaborating with many research groups from around the world and publishing several articles in high-impact journals [2].

In recent years, I have also developed a passion for programming and artificial intelligence. It all started with small projects like building a personal website,  developing a slack bot for our research group. Now I'm diving deeper into machine learning and exploring how it can be used to solve interesting and relevant problems.

I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow both personally and professionally. If you think a project or collaboration would be interesting for me, don't hesitate to contact me!
